Project Explanation
For this project, I worked on training an intelligent agent using a Q-learning algorithm. I was given the basic structure of the code, which included the initialization of parameters and the framework for the Q-learning loop. My task was to complete the code to ensure the agent could effectively learn and navigate a maze to find a treasure.

Given Code:
	•	The initial setup for the Q-learning parameters like n_epoch, max_memory, and data_size.
	•	The framework for the Q-learning loop, including placeholders for the exploration-exploitation balance and experience replay.

Code I Created:
	•	I implemented the main training loop, where the agent randomly selects a starting position, explores the maze, and updates its knowledge based on rewards and penalties.
	•	I added the logic for balancing exploration and exploitation, ensuring the agent learns efficiently.
	•	I integrated the experience replay mechanism to help the agent learn from past experiences and improve its decision-making.
	•	I wrote the code for training the neural network model with the collected data and tracking the training progress.

Role of Computer Scientists:
Computer scientists design and develop algorithms, software, and systems that solve complex problems and improve our daily lives. Their work matters because it drives technological innovation, enhances efficiency, and enables new capabilities across various fields, from healthcare to entertainment.

Approach to Problem-Solving:
As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically. I start by understanding the problem requirements, breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. I then design algorithms to solve these tasks, implement the solutions in code, and test thoroughly to ensure they work correctly. Debugging and refining the code are crucial steps to optimize performance and accuracy.

Ethical Responsibilities:
My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the software I develop is reliable, safe, and respects user privacy. I must consider the potential impact of my work on end users and society, avoiding biases in algorithms and ensuring fairness. It’s also important to maintain transparency and accountability in the development process, making sure that users and organizations understand how the technology works and its potential limitations.

By working on this project, I applied these principles to develop a robust and ethical AI solution, contributing to the larger field of computer science and its goal of improving human life through technology.
